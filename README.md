- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @phc3_.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to program, HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript. I'm open to new tips to improve.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? Through my main means of communication, Instagram (@phc3_), and one more thing, just for additional information, I am Brazilian.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I'm don't have.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know absolutely nothing about javascript. So I'm open to tips and criticisms too.
